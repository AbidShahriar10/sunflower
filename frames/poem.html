              You're the music, i don't get bored listening.<br />
              You're the poetry, i can't stop reading.<br />
              You're my cinema, i can watch you forever.<br />
              You're the instinct, that makes me alive & happy.<br />
              You're the star, i can't touch.<br />
              Yet i wait to be with you, yet i wish to love you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stars spell out your name.<br />
              Romance growing like a flower in the summer.<br />
              You always keep me guessing, forever my wonder.<br />
              Love you just the way you are.
            </p>
            <p>
              I could watch you for a lifetime.<br />
              You're my favorite movie.<br />
              A thousand endings.<br />
              You mean everything to me.<br />
              I never know what's coming.<br />
              Forever fascinating.<br />
              Hope you don't stop running.<br />
              Because I'll always be waiting.
